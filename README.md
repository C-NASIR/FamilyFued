## HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
The game contains two main things, an excel file where you have a list of questions and their answers which you select when you start the game and the actual game which you just play

## The Excel file
This is the excel file, it has sheets at the bottom which the topic would go, for example, you create a sheet for exam1 review and another for exam2 review etc.
Then you list your questions at the top and their answers right under them, this is the format the application reads your questions and answers (example file is in the folder you can downlaod it.
